### Project Motivation
The purpose of this project is to create a regression model to predict a home sale value in King County Washington and use this model to answer questions about the housing market.

### Process Overview
- Obtain the data from the database
- Preprocess the data
- Explore the data
- Model the data
- Interpret the results

### Observations

This image shows a blue dot for all home sales in King County and other colored dots for homw sales in the five most expensive zipcodes. The purple section contains downtown Seattle.

### Findings
- The final model created achieved an r-squared value of .86, meaning it is very useful in modeling home sale prices.
- There is a premium of about $90,000 for being double the size of the average home in the neighborhood.
- The most expensive zipcodes are the ones located close to downtown Seattle and close to Lake Mercer.
- Being on the water commands a premium of over $115,000, which is the equivalent of adding 500 square feet of living space.

### Further Exploration
- Obtain home sale data from more years.
- Obtain different types of data such as proximity to parks, shopping centers, transportation routes, school quality and crime statistics.
- Employ more advanced modeling techniques.
